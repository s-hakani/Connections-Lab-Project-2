    <p id="explainer"> The prayers that are auto-populated come from a specific container created in October 2021: 10 people from Sarah's family together under one roof, mapping to the 10 dots above, saying goodbye to her grandmother who moved back to India. While the project intent is to be a prayer container for queer people of faith, the container of the multigenerational home in flux serves as a blueprint for what it looks like to house disparate but connected prayers. </p>
